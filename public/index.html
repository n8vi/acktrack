<h1>The ACKTRACK library</h1>
<p>
This is the home of the ACKTRACK library, useful for watching acknowledgements to TCP sessions your software is engaged in.
You can initialize an ACK tracker by passing a socket handle, or by passing strings describing each end of the connection.
The library is cross-platform, and is tested on Linux and Windows using gitlab CI.  Documentation is not complete yet, which
is to say that for the most part, the documentation is the fairly messy source code.  That will be cleaned up.  However ...
</p><p>
The funding for this project is temporarily suspended due to COVID-19.  While I intend to continue work on the library, I can 
make no guarantees of how quickly updates will occur.  
</p>

<h3>Downloads</h3>
The binaries gitlab-ci has compiled from the latest master branch are available here:
<ul>
<li><a href="acktrack.dll">acktrack.dll</a> - Windows, I think 32-bit, but I haven't verified.</li>
<li><a href="libacktrack.so">libacktrack.so</a> - Linux.  I'm not attempting proper library versioning ... yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Installer binaries and such may or may not be implemented at some point.  It doesn't entirely make sense to create an installer
for windows, since the user will have to manually install the npcap library dependency for license reasons anyway.
<p><p>
Archived old versions of binaries will be downloadable ... at some point.

The ACKTRACK library
</h1>
This is the home of the ACKTRACK library, useful for watching acknowledgements to TCP sessions your software is engaged in.
You can initialize an ACK tracker by passing a socket handle, or by passing strings describing each end of the connection.
The library is cross-platform, and is built on Linux and Windows using gitlab CI.  

<strike>The funding for this project is temporarily suspended due to COVID-19.  While I intend to continue work on the library, I can 
make no guarantees of how quickly updates will occur.</strike><br/>
Development is back on!

Installer binaries and such may or may not be implemented at some point.  It doesn't entirely make sense to create an installer
for windows, since the user will have to manually install the npcap library dependency for license reasons anyway.

Archived old versions of binaries will be downloadable ... at some point.  Source code can always be retrieved from
<a href="https://gitlab.com/n8vi/acktrack">https://gitlab.com/n8vi/acktrack</a>, and you can find old versions in 
the CI artifacts if you care to dig.

<h3>&quot;Documentation&quot;</h3>
(now with 100% more scare quotes)

<h4>Purpose</h4>
The general idea of the acktrack library is to get information about a TCP session you are engaged in either before your
operating system's socket library is willing to give it to you, or in the case the socket library doesn't provide said information.

The original use case was to figure out how much of the data you've sent to the remote end has been acknowledged.  This is done
by opening an acktrack object and either periodically checking lastlseq vs lastlack (if they are equal, then everything you've sent
has been acknowledged).  Perhaps you're working with an application-layer protocol that needs to time out when a packet isn't
acknowledged and for whatever reason you don't want to do acknowledgements in the application layer?  

A second use case that's cropped up is figuring out when the TCP session is in the process of ending before your socket library
wants you to know.  If your code's left hand isn't fully clear on what its right hand is up to, perhaps this is a way to determine
the socket is closing but the whole FIN/FINACK sequence isn't complete yet.

<h4>Logging functions</h4>
The acktrack library can log to a file for debugging if the application so desires.  The application may write its own messages
to this log for basic "printf-style" debugging.  The logfile can be opened with acktrack_openlog(), should be closed with 
acktrack_closelog(), and application messages are logged with acktrack_writelog().  Most likely, if your application calls
acktrack_openlog(), you'll see a lot more messages from within the library than from your own code.  I don't implement 
different levels of logging or anything, this is quite verbose.  Here's the function prototypes:

<ul>
<li style="margin-top:0px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">int  acktrack_openlog(const char* logfile)</li>
<li style="margin-top:0px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">void acktrack_writelog(char* msg)</li>
<li style="margin-top:0px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">void acktrack_closelog(void)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Opening and closing an ack tracker</h4>
acktrack_create() creates an acktrack_t object, which you can pass into later functions.
<ul>
<li style="margin-top:0px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">acktrack_t * acktrack_create(int sck);</li>
<li style="margin-top:0px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">void acktrack_free(acktrack_t *acktrack);</li>
</ul>

<h4>Operating the packet loop</h4>
There are two ways to consume packets from the buffer.  If you don't do either of these <i>nothing will happen</i>.  Acktrack_dispatch()
calls your callback cb with the next available packet, whereas acktrack_next() returns the next available packet.  Use whichever is
convenient.  The packet data is returned as a sequence_event_t object, which you can operate on with functions I shall describe shortly.
<ul>
<li style="margin-top:0px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">void acktrack_dispatch(acktrack_t * acktrack, acktrack_cb_t cb)</li>
<li style="margin-top:0px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">sequence_event_t * acktrack_next(acktrack_t * acktrack)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Looking for session termination</h4>
acktrack_isfinishing() returns 1 if either a FIN or RST has been received from either side.
acktrack_isfinished() returns 1 if either the full session teardown has taken place with FIN flags, or if an RST has been sent or received.
<ul>
<li style="margin-top:0px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">int acktrack_isfinished(acktrack_t *acktrack)</li>
<li style="margin-top:0px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">int acktrack_isfinishing(acktrack_t *acktrack)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Visual Basic convenience functions</h4>
It turns out to be quite difficult to figure out how to get at C struct members using visual basic, so I made some functions that just return members 
of the structs this library slings around.  It also turns out to be difficult to get at your actual socket handle in visual basic, so I gave up and 
made a variant of acktrack_create() that can take a pair of strings describing the connection you wish to monitor.  There is a visual basic example in the 
source code you can refer to for how to use that, but here's a gist:

<ul>
<li style="margin-top:0px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">
acktrack_t * acktrack_create_fromstrings(char* LocalEndPointStr, char* RemoteEndPointStr) <br/>
// Public Declare Ansi Function acktrack_create_fromstrings Lib "acktrack.dll" Alias "acktrack_create_fromstrings" (ByVal LocalEndPointStr As String, ByVal RemoteEndPointStr As String) As IntPtr <br/>
// cs = acktrack_create_fromstrings(socket.LocalEndPoint.ToString(), socket.RemoteEndPoint.ToString());
</li>
</ul>

What remains are the VB convenience functions for getting at the data locked up in those structs.  Functions named acktrack_se_something() are for
poking at the contents of sequence_event_t structs (representing individual packets), whereas functions named just acktrack_something() are for
poking at acktrack_t structs (representing TCP sessions).

<ul>
<li style="margin-top:0px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">u_int acktrack_lastrseq(acktrack_t *acktrack)</li>
<li style="margin-top:0px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">u_int acktrack_lastlseq(acktrack_t *acktrack)</li>
<li style="margin-top:0px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">u_int acktrack_lastrack(acktrack_t *acktrack)</li>
<li style="margin-top:0px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">u_int acktrack_lastlack(acktrack_t *acktrack)</li>
</ul>

<li style="margin-top:0px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">long acktrack_se_ts_usec(sequence_event_t *se)</li>

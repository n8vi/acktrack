Example linux/windows cross-platform code for creating a packet capture filtered to capture traffic associated
with a given socket can be found in "pcapsocket.c"

Under linux, "make" builds and "make test" runs the code under gdb.

Under windows, the code can be built with vidual studio by loading pcapsocket.sln.

Right now the code functions as a demo.  I am in the process of splitting it into a library and an
executable to demo that library, while maintaining linux/windows cross-platformness.

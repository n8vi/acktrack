Example linux/windows cross-platform code for creating a packet capture filtered to capture traffic associated
with a given socket can be found in "pcapsocket.c"

Under linux, "make" builds and "make test" runs the code under gdb.

Under windows, the code can be built and debugged with visual studio by loading pcapsocket.sln.

Right now the code compiles a DLL and a test EXE under visual studio.  I am in the process of making it compile
a shared object and a test binary in linux.

Example linux/windows cross-platform code for creating a packet capture filtered to capture traffic associated
with a given socket can be found in "acktrack.c"

Under linux, "make" should build and "make test" should run the code under gdb.  I haven't tested it recently so it may be broken.

Under windows, the code can be built and debugged with visual studio by loading acktrack.sln.

Right now the code compiles a DLL and two demo EXEs under visual studio, one written in C and the other in VB.  I am in the process
of making it compile a shared object and a test binary in linux.

Expect the project to be renamed soon.

A cross-platform library for keeping track of TCP ACKs in response to data sent on a socket.  Requires libpcap/winpcap/npcap.

Under linux, "make" builds the libacktrack.so shared library and the cdemo test binary, and "make test" runs the demo code
under gdb.

Under windows, the code can be built and debugged with visual studio by loading acktrack.sln.

Right now the code compiles a DLL and two demo EXEs under visual studio, one written in C and the other in VB.  

Currently the library only supports IPv4 sockets, but IPv6 should be added soon.

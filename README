Example code for creating a packet capture filtered to capture traffic associated with a given
socket can be found in "client.c"

Example linux/windows cross-platform libpcap code can be found in iflist.c.

Under linux, "make" builds both programs and "make test" runs the code in client.c under gdb.

Under windows, iflist.c can be built with vidual studio by loading iflist.sln.

The goal is to combine all lessons learned here into a single file "pcapsocket.c", which has
the functions to build and initialize a pcap filter to capture all packets related to a
socket on all interfaces.  At some point, expect this repository to contain only that.
